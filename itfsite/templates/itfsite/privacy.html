<h1>Your Privacy</h1>

{% include "page-section-nav.html" %}

<p><span class="site-brand">if.then.fund</span> is committed to respecting your privacy as we try to shape Congress. This page describes what happens to your information as you use the website.</p>

<h2>The information we collect</h2>

<dl>
	<dt>Contributor information</dt>
	<dd><p>When you use this website to make a campaign contribution, we ask for your name, address, occupation, employer, and contribution amount. When the campaign contribution is made (e.g. after a vote occurs), we must by law report this information to the recipients of your contribution (primary campaign committees) and to the Federal Election Commission, a government agency. The information becomes a part of the public record and will be searchable in online databases. We may also display your contributor information on this website either in aggregated or anonymized form.</p></dd>

	<dt>Action information</dt>
	<dd><p>We also ask you how you would vote on bills in Congress and how you would like to filter recipients. We may send this information to the recipients of your camapaign contributions, but this information is not sent to the Federal Election Commission and does not become a part of the public record. We may also display your action information on this website either in aggregated or anonymized form.</p></dd>

	<dt>Payment information</dt>
	<dd><p>We also ask for payment information: your credit card number, its expiration date, and its verification code. We store the last four digits of your credit card number, its expiration date, and a hashed (matchable but non-recoverable) form of your credit card number and expiration date. The other aspects of your payment information are used only transiently to authorize a charge. We do not charge your credit card until after a vote in Congress occurs, so we also store a random token associated with your credit card that allows us to make the future charge on your card when the vote occurs.</p></dd>

	<dt>Standard logs, cookies</dt>
	<dd><p>As with your visits to most other websites, the date and time of each resource you access, your computer&rsquo;s IP address, where you came from, and web browser properties are stored for fraud prevention and analytics purposes. We also set a cookie, which let&rsquo;s us remember who you are and is used for things such as keeping you logged in.</p></dd>

	<dt>Accounts</dt>
	<dd><p>If you create an account, we ask for your email address and a password to protect your account. Your password is stored only in hashed (matchable but non-recoverable) form. We will email you about your contributions and, if you&rsquo;d like, about other ways to take action on this website.</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>We currently retain all data indefinitely.</p>
